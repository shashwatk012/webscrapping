An anti perspirant is supposed to prevent you from sweating, this is meant for athletes, people with active lifestyle, people who sweat a lot or have to work in hot and humid environments. Unlike a deodorant which has a strong fragrance and can't prevent sweating whatsoever. Anti perspirants commonly use aluminum salts, which you can also see in its ingredients list, these are dermatologically tested to be safe on skin, this is the white powder people are referring to. This is meant to be sprayed on the body, specifically underarms and not clothes since the salt will leave stains on clothes. This creates a layer on the skin like talc that reacts with the sweat and keeps it dry for long hours. These are alcohol free and do not have a strong or long lasting smell but they provide great prevention from sweat, which is exactly what they are meant to do. Anti perspirants work best when you spray it on over clean dry skin and allow it some time before you step out and start sweating. No anti perspirant is 100% efficient in preventing sweat but it does work really well even if you're sweating at a slow pace throughout the day, heavy sweating can't really be prevented with the roll-on anti perspirants either, which by the way are the most effective anti perspirants being much more dense than spray on products, having said that, all products work to some realistic extents only.

It has a very mild fragrance, so it is not for someone who is looking for a bold one. It suits my use, as I am happy with the way it prevents the odor in the first place by preventing sweat(antiperspirant), rather than suppressing it with the scent.""}]","1,241 total ratings, 94 with reviews","[{""name"":""Amazon Customer"",""review"":""A lot of people have given negative reviews for this product claiming that it has some white powder and that it appears to be fake, etc. This review is for those people who are confusing this for a deodorant and who may be unaware about antiperspirants.

An anti perspirant is supposed to prevent you from sweating, this is meant for athletes, people with active lifestyle, people who sweat a lot or have to work in hot and humid environments. Unlike a deodorant which has a strong fragrance and can't prevent sweating whatsoever. Anti perspirants commonly use aluminum salts, which you can also see in its ingredients list, these are dermatologically tested to be safe on skin, this is the white powder people are referring to. This is meant to be sprayed on the body, specifically underarms and not clothes since the salt will leave stains on clothes. This creates a layer on the skin like talc that reacts with the sweat and keeps it dry for long hours. These are alcohol free and do not have a strong or long lasting smell but they provide great prevention from sweat, which is exactly what they are meant to do. Anti perspirants work best when you spray it on over clean dry skin and allow it some time before you step out and start sweating. No anti perspirant is 100% efficient in preventing sweat but it does work really well even if you're sweating at a slow pace throughout the day, heavy sweating can't really be prevented with the roll-on anti perspirants either, which by the way are the most effective anti perspirants being much more dense than spray on products, having said that, all products work to some realistic extents only.

I bought it taken in by their hype of testing the product in their lab, hoping that the product wouldn't irritate.Alpine scent is moreover a more masculine fragrance totally unsuited for women though it's touted as a unisex fragrance.Highly unrecommended: use at your own risk.

I've  been using Nivea deodorants for the past few years and have been nothing less than thoroughly satisfied.

The 48 hour long claim is a bogus one--it lasts maximum for a day, but it is still excellent for this price point. I got it on a 40% discount from Amazon, so I'm very pleased about that! My only grouse is that it was manufactured in Dec '16, but it is good to use till next year, and as far as I can tell, it hasn't affected the workability of the product, so can hardly complain about that! All in all, this is an excellent product, very fresh and feminine, and a must-have in your shower! Go for it, ladies!Edit: I'm super confused by all the reviewers claiming that this deodorant leaves a white cast behind on clothes.
