Additionally, the 50 MP main camera on this smartphone beautifully catches every detail you see. Additionally, Super Night Selfie employs noise cancellation technology in conjunction with an Aura Screen Light to produce a calming light that is effective in low light. The pioneering Extended RAM 3.0 technology also uses ROM to expand RAM with a maximum capacity of 8 GB. This enables smooth app switching and allows up to 27 active applications to run in the background.",

An additional benefit of this phone is its 120 Hz Pro AMOLED display with adaptive sync, which provides a fluid, lively, and engaging user experience.
